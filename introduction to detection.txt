We are going to use a model from the Tensorflow Hub library, which has multiple ready to deploy models trained in all kinds of datasets and to solve all kinds of problems. For our use, I filtered models trained for object detection tasks and models in the TFLite format. This format is usually used for IoT applications, for its small size and faster performance than bigger models. I choose this format because I intend to use this model on a Rasberry Pi on future projects
